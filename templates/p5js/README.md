### Use p5.js

1. Navigate to the `p5js` directory with `cd ../p5js`.
2. Put your js code in `input/02_main.js`.
3. Run `make clean && make` in the terminal.
4. Your final file will be `index.html`.
5. To check if `index.html` file works locally, open `index.html` and search and replace "fetch(/content/" with "fetch(https://ordinals.com/content/" (2 places).
